    "You can understand this arrow as being the *relationship* between a tarantula and a hamster, in terms of their size and cuteness (i.e., hamsters and tarantulas are about the same size, but hamsters are much cuter). In the same diagram, I've also transposed this same arrow (this time in red) so that its origin point is \"chicken.\" The arrow ends closest to \"kitten.\" What we've discovered is that the animal that is about the same size as a chicken but much cuter is... a kitten. To put it in terms of an analogy:\n",

    "A sequence of numbers used to identify a point is called a *vector*, and the kind of math we've been doing so far is called *linear algebra.* (Linear algebra is surprisingly useful across many domains: It's the same kind of math you might do to, e.g., simulate the velocity and acceleration of a sprite in a video game.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of vectors that are all part of the same data set is often called a *vector space*. The vector space of animals in this section has two *dimensions*, by which I mean that each vector in the space has two numbers associated with it (i.e., two columns in the spreadsheet). The fact that this space has two dimensions just happens to make it easy to *visualize* the space by drawing a 2D plot. But most vector spaces you'll work with will have more than two dimensions—sometimes many hundreds. In those cases, it's more difficult to visualize the \"space,\" but the math works pretty much the same."

    "\n",
    "So far, so good. We have a system in place—albeit highly subjective—for talking about animals and the words used to name them. I want to talk about another vector space that has to do with language: the vector space of colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colors are often represented in computers as vectors with three dimensions: red, green, and blue. Just as with the animals in the previous section, we can use these vectors to answer questions like: which colors are similar? What's the most likely color name for an arbitrarily chosen set of values for red, green and blue? Given the names of two colors, what's the name of those colors' \"average\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with this [color data](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/colors/xkcd.json) from the [xkcd color survey](https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/). The data relates a color name to the RGB value associated with that color. [Here's a page that shows what the colors look like](https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/). Download the color data and put it in the same directory as this notebook.\n",

    "* The linear algebra functions implemented below (`addv`, `meanv`, etc.) are slow, potentially inaccurate, and shouldn't be used for \"real\" code—I wrote them so beginner programmers can understand how these kinds of functions work behind the scenes. Use [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for fast and accurate math in Python.\n",
    "* If you're interested in perceptually accurate color math in Python, consider using the [colormath library](http://python-colormath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",

    "Just as we wanted to find the animal that most closely matched an arbitrary point in cuteness/size space, we'll want to find the closest color name to an arbitrary point in RGB space. The easiest way to find the closest item to an arbitrary vector is simply to find the distance between the target vector and each item in the space, in turn, then sort the list from closest to farthest. The `closest()` function below does just that. By default, it returns a list of the ten closest items to the given vector.\n",

    "Because there are ten possible contexts, this is a ten dimensional space! It might be strange to think of it, but you can do vector arithmetic on vectors with ten dimensions just as easily as you can on vectors with two or three dimensions, and you could use the same distance formula that we defined earlier to get useful information about which vectors in this space are similar to each other. In particular, the vectors for `best` and `worst` are actually the same (a distance of zero), since they occur only in the same context (`the ___ of`):\n",

    "Of course, the conventional way of thinking about \"best\" and \"worst\" is that they're *antonyms*, not *synonyms*. But they're also clearly two words of the same kind, with related meanings (through opposition), a fact that is captured by this distributional model.\n",

    "### Contexts and dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, in a corpus of any reasonable size, there will be many thousands if not many millions of possible contexts. It's difficult enough working with a vector space of ten dimensions, let alone a vector space of a million dimensions! It turns out, though, that many of the dimensions end up being superfluous and can either be eliminated or combined with other dimensions without significantly affecting the predictive power of the resulting vectors. The process of getting rid of superfluous dimensions in a vector space is called [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction), and most implementations of count-based word vectors make use of dimensionality reduction so that the resulting vector space has a reasonable number of dimensions (say, 100—300, depending on the corpus and application).\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of how to identify a \"context\" is itself very difficult to answer. In the toy example above, we've said that a \"context\" is just the word that precedes and the word that follows. Depending on your implementation of this procedure, though, you might want a context with a bigger \"window\" (e.g., two words before and after), or a non-contiguous window (skip a word before and after the given word). You might exclude certain \"function\" words like \"the\" and \"of\" when determining a word's context, or you might [lemmatize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation) the words before you begin your analysis, so two occurrences with different \"forms\" of the same word count as the same context. These are all questions open to research and debate, and different implementations of procedures for creating count-based word vectors make different decisions on this issue.\n",
