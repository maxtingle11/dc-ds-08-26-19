    "Gradient Descent is an approach to minimize error by moving toward the local minimum of a cost curve toward the y-intercept and slope that minimize the cost function. To find the minimum we use step down the cost curve, and as we move down the curve we adjust the size of our step based on the slope of the curve observed at each point. When the slope is steep, it indicates we are further away from the minimum, so we take a larger step to the next point to test how close we are to the minimum. As the slope gets less steep, we take smaller steps as we approach the minimum. The goal is to reach the point where the slope of the tangent line is close 0, as that would be when the slope has flattened at the minimum."
